/*
In this file, I'll see operators, and how the differents variables types reacts to them, and to operations. 
This will also lead to maybe the creation of another file in which I'll dig variables conversions.
Or i'll dig it on this file, we'll see. But it will be learnt. 
Anyway. here's the base tutorial followed here : 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E3I1URu6fc&list=PLZPZq0r_RZOOzY_vR4zJM32SqsSInGMwe&index=9
And this is the wikipedia article that we will also follow and dig : 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operators_in_C_and_C%2B%2B
And yes, i'll like to see every one of them, try to break them, but mostly understand how they interact. 
With erery type of variable. we're in for a long ride. 
We may learn quite a few things within it. Will it be fun ? Well, for me, surely.
