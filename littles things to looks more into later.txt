Things i've noted but didn't tried to understand so far, 
and that i'll have to dig later on : 
-can't start the name of a variable with a number. 
- How to add, or delete one or many array indexes. 
	in every dimensions.
-snprintf and printf course. what's the whole range of possibilities, 
	and what are they useful for. 
- differences between a console, a compiler, MingW, GCC, and else. Need to dive deeper.
- dig the inversion operation breaking bad meme. 
- values types : Rvalues, Lvalues, and other if there are. 
- char* (chack if not already clarified in C_variables)
